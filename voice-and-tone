More formal than informal. We realize we are managing our customers’ data and, therefore, we are relatively serious in our communication. 
Our customers are business professionals, so we strive to reflect to professional aspect of this. Being concise and focused is a key tenant for us since our customers don’t have time to spare.
That being said, we also realize there are moments of delight when our customers are able to solve a problem with our software. To emphasize these moments, our communication evolves to include “low-key” celebrations.
